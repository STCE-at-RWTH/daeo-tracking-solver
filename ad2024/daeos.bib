  abstract = {We are considering differential-algebraic equations with embedded optimization criteria (DAEOs) in which the embedded optimization problem is solved by global optimization. This actually leads to differential inclusions for cases in which there are multiple global optimizer at the same time. Jump events from one global optimum to another result in nonsmooth DAEs and thus reduction of the convergence order of the numerical integrator to first-order. Implementation of event detection and location as introduced in this work preserves the higher-order convergence behavior of the integrator. This allows to compute discrete tangents and adjoint sensitivities for optimal control problems.},

  abstract = {Generalized intervals (intervals whose bounds are not constrained to be increasingly ordered) extend classical intervals providing better algebraic properties. In particular, the generalized interval arithmetic is a group for addition and for multiplication of zero free intervals. These properties allow one constructing a LU decomposition of a generalized interval matrix A: the two computed generalized interval matrices L and U satisfy A = LU with equality instead of the weaker inclusion obtained in the context of classical intervals. Some potential applications of this generalized interval LU decomposition are investigated.},

  abstract = {We start with a mathematical definition of a real interval as a closed, connected set of reals. Interval arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) are likewise defined mathematically and we provide algorithms for computing these operations assuming exact real arithmetic. Next, we define interval arithmetic operations on intervals with IEEE 754 floating point endpoints to be sound and optimal approximations of the real interval operations and we show that the IEEE standard’s specification of operations involving the signed infinities, signed zeros, and the exact/inexact flag are such as to make a correct and optimal implementation more efficient. From the resulting theorems we derive data that are sufficiently detailed to convert directly to a program for efficiently implementing the interval operations. Finally we extend these results to the case of general intervals, which are defined as connected sets of reals that are not necessarily closed.},

  abstract = {In this paper we shed more light on determinants of interval matrices. Computing the exact bounds on a determinant of an interval matrix is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, attention is first paid to approximations. NP-hardness of both relative and absolute approximation is proved. Next, methods computing verified enclosures of interval determinants and their possible combination with preconditioning are discussed. A new method based on Cramer's rule was designed. It returns similar results to the state-of-the-art method, however, it is less consuming regarding computational time. As a byproduct, the Gerschgorin circles were generalized for interval matrices. New results about classes of interval matrices with polynomially computable tasks related to determinant are proved (symmetric positive definite matrices, class of matrices with identity midpoint matrix, tridiagonal H-matrices). The mentioned methods were exhaustively compared for random general and symmetric matrices.},

  abstract = {The right-hand sides of a system of ordinary differential equations may be discontinuous on a certain surface. If a trajectory crossing this surface shall be computed by a one-step method, then a particular numerical analysis is necessary in a neighbourhood of the point of intersection. Such an analysis is presented in this paper. It shows that one can obtain any desired order of convergence if the method has an adequate order of consistency. Moreover, an asymptotic error theory is developed to justify Richardson extrapolation. A general one-step method is constructed satisfying the conditions of the preceding theory. Finally, a simplified Newton iteration scheme is used to implement this method.},

  abstract = {A biorefinery comprises a variety of process steps to synthesize products from sustainable natural resources. Dynamic plant-wide simulation enhances the process understanding, leads to improved cost efficiency and enables model-based operation and control. It is thereby important for an increased competitiveness to conventional processes. To this end, we developed a Modelica library with replaceable building blocks that allow dynamic modeling of an entire biorefinery. For the microbial conversion step, we built on the dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) approach to formulate process models for the simulation of cellular metabolism under changing environmental conditions. The resulting system of differential-algebraic equations with embedded optimization criteria (DAEO) is solved by a tailor-made toolbox. In summary, our modeling framework comprises three major pillars: A Modelica library of dynamic unit operations, an easy-to-use interface to formulate DFBA process models and a DAEO toolbox that allows simulation with standard environments based on the Modelica modeling language. A biorefinery model for dynamic simulation of the OrganoCat pretreatment process and microbial conversion of the resulting feedstock by Corynebacterium glutamicum serves as case study to demonstrate its practical relevance.},
