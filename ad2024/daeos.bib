  abstract = {Abstract             Equations of state are used to predict or to match equilibrium fluid phase behavior for systems as diverse as distillation columns and miscible gas floods of oil reservoirs. The success of such simulations depends on correct predictions of the number and the compositions of phases present at a given temperature, pressure, and overall fluid composition. For example, recent research has shown that three or more phases may exist in equilibrium in CO2 floods.             This paper shows why an equation of state can predict the incorrect number of phases or incorrect phase compositions. The incorrect phase descriptions still satisfy the usual restrictions on equality of chemical potentials of components in each phase and conservation of moles in the system. A new method and its mathematical proof are presented for determining when a phase equilibrium solution is incorrect.             Examples of instances where incorrect predictions may be made are described. These include a binary system in which a two-phase solution may be predicted for a single-phase fluid and a multicomponent CO2/reservoir oil system in which three or more phases may coexist.},

From the resulting theorems we derive data that are sufficiently detailed to convert directly to a program for efficiently implementing the interval operations. Finally we extend these results to the case of general intervals, which are defined as connected sets of reals that are not necessarily closed.},

Next, methods computing verified enclosures of interval determinants and their possible combination with preconditioning are discussed. A new method based on Cramer's rule was designed. It returns similar results to the state-of-the-art method, however, it is less consuming regarding computational time. As a byproduct, the Gerschgorin circles were generalized for interval matrices. New results about classes of interval matrices with polynomially computable tasks related to determinant are proved (symmetric positive definite matrices, class of matrices with identity midpoint matrix, tridiagonal H-matrices). The mentioned methods were exhaustively compared for random general and symmetric matrices.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of stochastic models for describing complex phenomena warrants surrogate models that capture the reference model characteristics at a fraction of the computational cost, foregoing potentially expensive Monte Carlo simulation. The predominant approach of fitting a large neural network and then pruning it to a reduced size has commonly neglected shortcomings. The produced surrogate models often will not capture the sensitivities and uncertainties inherent in the original model. In particular, (higher-order) derivative information of such surrogates could differ drastically. Given a large enough network, we expect this derivative information to match. However, the pruned model will almost certainly not share this behavior.  In this paper, we propose to find surrogate models by using sensitivity information throughout the learning and pruning process. We build on work using Interval Adjoint Significance Analysis for pruning and combine it with the recent advancements in Sobolev Training to accurately model the original sensitivity information in the pruned neural network based surrogate model. We experimentally underpin the method on an example of pricing a multidimensional Basket option modelled through a stochastic differential equation with Brownian motion. The proposed method is, however, not limited to the domain of quantitative finance, which was chosen as a case study for intuitive interpretations of the sensitivities. It serves as a foundation for building further surrogate modelling techniques considering sensitivity information.},

This solution approach tracks a stationary point of the embedded optimization problem that may not be globally or locally optimal on the total time horizon for non-convex problems. We use adjoint sensitivity analysis for the resulting nonsmooth DAEs for gradient-based optimization in a direct single-shooting approach. We apply the solution method to the optimization of a single flash unit, calculation of an optimal start-up scenario of a rectification column, and the optimization of biomass growth in a microbial transformation process.},

Dynamic plant-wide simulation enhances the process understanding, leads to improved cost efficiency and enables model-based operation and control. It is thereby important for an increased competitiveness to conventional processes. To this end, we developed a Modelica library with replaceable building blocks that allow dynamic modeling of an entire biorefinery. For the microbial conversion step, we built on the dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) approach to formulate process models for the simulation of cellular metabolism under changing environmental conditions. The resulting system of differential-algebraic equations with embedded optimization criteria (DAEO) is solved by a tailor-made toolbox. In summary, our modeling framework comprises three major pillars: A Modelica library of dynamic unit operations, an easy-to-use interface to formulate DFBA process models and a DAEO toolbox that allows simulation with standard environments based on the Modelica modeling language. A biorefinery model for dynamic simulation of the OrganoCat pretreatment process and microbial conversion of the resulting feedstock by Corynebacterium glutamicum serves as case study to demonstrate its practical relevance.},

  abstract = {Algorithms are presented which find one or all of the critical points of a smooth function in a rectangular region, or the critical points at which the function has maximum or minimum value. If no critical points of the function exist in the given region, then the algorithm verifies this fact. The computation is self-validating, in that the existence or nonexistence of critical points is established conclusively, and guaranteed upper and lower bounds are computed for all quantities of interest, including the values of the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of the function. The algorithm makes use of an existing implementation of automatic differentiation and interval computation. Numerical examples are given.},
